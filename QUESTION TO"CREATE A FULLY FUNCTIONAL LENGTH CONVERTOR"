//welcome to a New Challenge 
//In This Challenge you Will be Given a Task of Creating A fully Functional Length Converter
//You must take only Five Varibles in the Code 


//HINT :- USE "SCANF"and "PRINTF" Functions for Better Code
//HINT :-TAKE INPUT AS METER VALUE AND THEN APPLY LOGIC
//HINT :-The Values To Be convrted are METER into CENTIMETER,INCH,FEET,KILOMETER


//Create a Fully functional Length converter that converts Meter value into  CENTIMETER,INCH,FEET,KILOMETER
//You Should Print values of CENTIMETER,INCH,FEET,KILOMETER On The Output Screen


SOLUTION TO THIS QUESTION IS IN THE FILE {SOLUTION TO "CREATE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL LENGTH CONVERTOR"}
//HOPE YOU WILL SOLVE THIS CHALLENGE 
//BEST OF LUCK
